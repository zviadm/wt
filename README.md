# wt - GoLang bindings for WiredTiger

These bindings mainly focus on performance and simplicity. Target is to
support WiredTiger only as a simple transactional key/value store.

WiredTiger is a high quality, production ready storage engine. It also has an extensive
in-depth documentation: http://source.wiredtiger.com/3.2.1/index.html.

If you have a need for a storage engine, give WiredTiger a shot instead of RocksDB.

# Testing

TODO(zviad): describe how to test using `docker` and `tt`.
